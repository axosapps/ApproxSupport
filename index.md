## Welcome to Approx

This is a different quiz game...
Each game has 8 question from different categories, all questions have a number as the answer, there are no options to choose from, you have to type the number you think the right answer is.
The game is played online by 2 players, each game has two rounds of four questions, the first player (creator of the game) answers the questions of the first round, waits until the second player answers them also, then the first player can play the second round, and then wait again until the opponent plays the second round, to end the game.
The player that has answered the closest number to the right answer increases his score by 1. That means, you don't have to know the right answer for every question to win, you can guess and with a little bit of luck you will be close to the right answer.

You get: 
50 points when you win a game
30 points when the game is a draw
10 points when you lose a game
20 points when your number is the right answer
15 points when your answer is better
10 points when both players have equal answers
5 points when opponent's answer is better than yours

The more points you select the more levels you will grow, the more profile pictures you will unlock.

Leaderboards
There are 4 leaderboards, All-Time, Day, Week and Month with the top 100 players that have collected the most points in each period, the winners of each of them get a crown as a reward.
Good Luck..
